# cae-crb
A tool that generates the HTML for the body of the email, after the user inputs information.


####Backstory: 
I currently receive an Excel file with the top articles for each topic. The columns of information that I need from the file are: topic, url, title, teaser, and citation. I only use the top five articles, of the topic. 


####Goal: 
To find a way to speed up the production of the CAE HTML emails. Ads will have to be taken into consideration.

#####Status Update
